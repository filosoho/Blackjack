# Game Rules

* The deck is unlimited in size. There are no jokers.
* The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
* The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
* The cards in the deck have equal probability of being drawn.
* Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.

# Getting Started

The game will prompt you to input whether you want to play or not.

# Gameplay
* You will start with two cards, and the dealer (computer) will start with one card.  
* You can choose to hit (draw another card) or stand (keep your current hand) to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.  
* Once you stand, the dealer will draw cards until they have 17 or more points.  
* If you win, you get double your bet. If you lose, you lose your bet. If you tie, you keep your bet.
